# EDA-Udacity

This contains the exercises done on the Data Analysis with R course by Udacity, from lessons 2 to 5. There are some datasets that were acquired from gapminder as well.

There is some exemple starting code from Udacity that was made available on github, and there is a lot of my code as I did the exercises.
